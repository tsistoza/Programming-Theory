# Little Arcade Survival Game (HIATUS - LEARNING BLENDER)
* Started on Sept. 30, 2024
* Basis is very simple enemies will spawn and all you have to do is survive
# Concept
---
## Score
* Score is being tallied by the number of wave you manage to complete, the more waves you complete the harder the game gets
## PowerUps
* After every wave, there will be an intermediary wave which will spawn three power ups from which you can choose from
* These powerups are still a wip
## Enemies
* The enemies will change based on the wave.
* Multiple different enemies, all of which do different things
* Occasionally spawn a special elite enemy
